//2. What is OOP? List OOP concepts
As the name suggests, Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that
use objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world 
entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming. The main aim of 
OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other
part of the code can access this data except that function.
